                On DJI’s website we can see that they are implementing a design choice with visual hierarchy for one of
                their products. If we follow the circles, we can see that the biggest thing on screen at the moment is
                their DJI RS 2 Gimbal, this will be the first thing that the audience looks at and grab their attention.
                The second thing they will look at is the title which is DJI RS 2 Masterfully Crafted. And then just
                under that is a video to see the product in action, and then lastly a big blue “Buy Now” button at the
                top of the screen which scrolls with the page so that they can press it whenever the audience wants.
                These are important because you wouldn’t want to have a big “Buy Now” button that takes up the whole
                screen and doesn’t show off the product first, people will be turned off by this and maybe leave the
                website all together.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://dbrand.com/">Dbrand</a>
            </h3>
            <img src="images/drband.jpg" alt="dbrand website showing rule of thirds">
            <p>
                Let’s take a look at Dbrand's website, this is on the main page and as you scroll you notice that the
                products that they are showcasing have similarities. Take this screenshot for example, when we place a
                grid over the top of it we can see that at the top right intersection and the bottom left intersection
                they placed the phones. This is because our eyes naturally gravitate over to those intersections
                subconsciously and we enjoy pictures more when they are in that range.

            <h2>Law of Symmetry</h2>

                    href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/?smcid=pdc%3Aen-us%3Aprimary%20nav%3Amsg-hardware%3Aps5">Playstation</a>
            </h3>
            <img src="images/ps5.jpg" alt="playstations website showing law of symmetry">
            <p>
                Take a look at Sony's PlayStation website. As you scroll down the page you come upon the new PlayStation
                5 controller. The way they put the controller relative to the page is admirable and we can see the
                symmetry that they are going for. The controller itself is very symmetrical with the joysticks and the
                button placements and of course the big touchpad in the middle and even the speaker holes are
                symmetrical. When we look at images like this our minds recognize the symmetry and find it pleasing and
                attractive. Our brains like when things are divided evenly and helps form it towards a center point
                which in this case is the PlayStation symbol in the middle of the controller.
