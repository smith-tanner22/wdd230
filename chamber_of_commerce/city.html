        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Thatcher is a town in Graham County, Arizona, United States. According to the 2020 Census, the population of
            the town is 5,264. It is part of the Safford Micropolitan Statistical Area. Thatcher is the home of Eastern
            Arizona College, a college that offers two year degrees and includes a nursing school.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Thatcher was originally settled by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The first
            settler was John M. Moody who arrived in Thatcher with his wife and children in 1881.[10] The founding of
            Thatcher is attributed to Mormon pioneer Christopher Layton, who bought two thousand acres, named the
            acreage "Thatcher", divided them into lots, and sold those lots to Mormon settlers. Layton also bought a
            gristmill and built roads, canals and homes.</p>
        <p>Eastern Arizona College traces its history to the St. Joseph Stake Academy started by the church in nearby
            Central. Central is also the location of the Gila Valley Arizona Temple.</p>
        <h2>What is Thatcher known for?</h2>
        <p>
            Cotton is the principal agricultural commodity. Another major contributor is the copper mining by the
            Freeport-McMoRan Corporation.</p>

            and head out to the Coronado National Forest surrounding town.</p>
