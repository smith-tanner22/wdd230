            <p>Thatcher was originally settled by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The first
                settler was John M. Moody who arrived in Thatcher with his wife and children in 1881.[10] The founding of
                Thatcher is attributed to Mormon pioneer Christopher Layton, who bought two thousand acres, named the
                acreage "Thatcher", divided them into lots, and sold those lots to Mormon settlers. Layton also bought a
                gristmill and built roads, canals and homes.</p>
                <p>Eastern Arizona College traces its history to the St. Joseph Stake Academy started by the church in nearby
                    Central. Central is also the location of the Gila Valley Arizona Temple.</p>
